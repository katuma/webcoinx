more intricate details
======================
This is just quick and dirty to get people started. Actual code for browser code happens to live in https://github.com/katuma/bitcoinjs-gui https://github.com/katuma/bitcoinjs-lib

Server, which only provides access to bulk blockchain data lives in https://github.com/katuma/node-bitcoin-exit and is rather intricate to setup. You will also need Linux VPS for that (nodejs cloud hosting wont do).

Visit #bitcoinx @ freenode (my nick is tumak) if you have further questions.

Have fun!
